# zillow_information
Shiny app to get various zillow data points on a property.

## Functionality
The app accepts either a CSV upload file with address information (and provides a template) or direct text input of new line separated addresses.  The output is downloadable as a CSV and also directly displayed in an HTML table.

The project was done some years ago and is not well commented, but a live link to a functioning implementation is available here: https://danielhopp.shinyapps.io/Zillow/
